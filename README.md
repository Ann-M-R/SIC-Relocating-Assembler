## Relocating SIC Assembler  

Relocating SIC assembler using bitmask

To execute the assembler, follow any one of the three instructions:  
1. To execute though command line by giving text file as input,  
        -> g++ code.cpp -o main  
        -> .\main "input1.txt"

2. To execute though command line normally,  
        a) g++ code.cpp  
        b) .\a

3.  Run code.cpp in an IDE

Two text files will be generated
1.  record.txt - contains object program.
2.  finalobjectcode.txt - contains object program with relocation by bitmask.

input1.txt ARRSUM.          (Program to sum two arrays and store in 3rd array)  
input2.txt contains PRODUCT.(Program to multiply two numbers by repeated addition)  
input3.txt contains SUM.    (Program to sum the elements of an array)
